# canonical-guest-build.sh — the ONE sanctioned way to build a pinnable SP1
# guest ELF for this repository.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# A guest ELF built the ordinary way is a function of the absolute path of the
# checkout it was built in. Two separate mechanisms cause that, and both are
# measured, not assumed (see README.md for the experiment and its controls):
#
#   1. Cargo's `-Cmetadata` (the crate disambiguator). Cargo normally strips the
#      workspace prefix from a path dependency so the hash is relocatable. When
#      the dependency lies OUTSIDE the Cargo workspace root that `strip_prefix`
#      fails and Cargo falls back to hashing the ABSOLUTE path. The SP1
#      workspaces here are rooted at `tools/…-sp1` while their parity crates are
#      sibling directories at `tools/…-rust-parity` — outside the root. So every
#      disambiguator, and transitively every downstream crate's disambiguator,
#      moves when the checkout moves.
#
#   2. Literal path strings in the ELF. The guest ELFs carry the absolute source
#      paths of the out-of-workspace parity crates (panic-location strings), plus
#      absolute `~/.cargo/registry` and `~/.sp1/toolchains` paths. Those strings
#      change LENGTH with the path, which is why byte length moves too.
#
# `--remap-path-prefix` fixes NEITHER. It cannot rewrite a `-Cmetadata` value
# Cargo already computed (measured: identical metadata with and without it), and
# it never reaches the build anyway because `sp1-build` SETS rather than appends
# `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`, so ambient `RUSTFLAGS` is discarded.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
# ----------------------
# It builds inside a digest-pinned container where the checkout is bind-mounted
# at a FIXED path, `/root/program`. Every absolute path that feeds either
# mechanism — the workspace root, the out-of-workspace parity crates, the cargo
# registry, the toolchain — becomes the same string no matter where the host
# checkout lives. The host path stops being an input.
#
# The `--workspace-directory` must be the REPO ROOT, not the SP1 workspace root.
# `sp1-build` mounts exactly that one directory; pointing it at `tools/…-sp1`
# would leave the sibling parity crates outside the mount and the build would
# fail to resolve them.
#
# WHAT WOULD BREAK IT
# -------------------
#   * Changing SP1_CANONICAL_IMAGE_DIGEST. The image carries the rustc that
#     compiles the guest; a different image is a different program.
#   * Passing a different --workspace-directory, or moving any selected SP1
#     workspace or parity crate to a different depth under the repo root. The
#     in-container path is derived from the path relative to the repo root, so
#     the RELATIVE layout is now load-bearing even though the absolute one is
#     not.
#   * Dropping `--locked`, which would let dependency resolution drift.
#   * Activating a Cargo feature. Cargo mixes enabled features into the same
#     `-Cmetadata` hash, so a feature change moves every disambiguator.
#   * Renaming the repo-root directory itself does NOT break it — that is the
#     whole point — but renaming `tools/…` does.
